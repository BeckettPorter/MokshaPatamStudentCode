| April 5       |    9-10pm     |                                                      I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 2nd |   5-5:30 pm   |                                                              Started working on helper methods. |
| September 3rd | 4:15-4:45 pm  |                           Tried to fix bugs and get the code closer to working. (still doesn't) |
| September 4th | 11:30 - 12:00 |               Refactoring code because I realized it won't work and I need to check for snakes. |
| September 4th |  3:20 - 3:50   | More refactoring and actually got it somewhat close to working, added some new helper meethods. |
